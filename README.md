## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing star data to explore the properties of stars, such as their types, magnitudes, temperatures, and constellations. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships in the data, such as the distribution of star types, the relationship between magnitude and temperature, and the most common constellations. This project combines **data science** and **astronomy** to create visually stunning and scientifically meaningful insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **HYG Star Database**, which contains the following key features:
- **Magnitude (mag)**: The apparent magnitude of the star.
- **Temperature (temp)**: The temperature of the star in Kelvin.
- **Distance (dist)**: The distance of the star from Earth in parsecs.
- **Spectral Type (spect)**: The spectral classification of the star (e.g., M, K, G).
- **Constellation (con)**: The constellation to which the star belongs.

The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from [here](http://www.astronexus.com/hyg).
